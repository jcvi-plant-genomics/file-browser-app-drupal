# JS File Browser Drupal Shim

This is a module for injecting the JS File Browser (by Araport) into a Drupal based environment.

The module code adds the necessary CSS and JS files into the page and controls the display based on login state (i.e if user is logged out, it guides the user through the login flow and back to the File Browser).

The JS File Browser code ([https://github.com/vivekkrish/file-browser-app](https://github.com/vivekkrish/file-browser-app)) is linked as a submodule to this repository
